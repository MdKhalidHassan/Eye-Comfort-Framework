# 👁️ Eye Comfort Framework

**Eye Comfort Framework** is a professional, research-aligned Chrome extension designed to reduce eye strain, visual fatigue, and night-time screen discomfort using visual ergonomics and circadian-safe principles.

Unlike typical blue-light filter extensions, this project follows a **multi-factor eye comfort model** instead of relying on a single color filter.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> **Eye comfort is not a filter — it is the reduction of total visual load.**

This extension is built on the understanding that digital eye strain is caused by multiple interacting factors such as brightness, contrast, color temperature, and prolonged focus — not blue light alone.

---

## 🔬 Eye Comfort Framework (Core Modules)

The extension is structured around **four scientifically validated modules**:

### 1️⃣ Circadian-Safe Blue Light Control
- Reduces excessive blue wavelength exposure
- Focused on night-time usage
- Avoids aggressive color distortion

### 2️⃣ Luminance (Brightness) Regulation
- Lowers retinal stress caused by high screen brightness
- Browser-level dimming (no system interference)

### 3️⃣ Contrast & Color Stress Optimization
- Reduces harsh contrast and pure white backgrounds
- Minimizes continuous micro-adjustments of the eye

### 4️⃣ Eye Physiology Protection (20-20-20 Rule)
- Gentle reminders every 20 minutes
- Supports eye muscle relaxation and blink normalization
